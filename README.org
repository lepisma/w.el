#+TITLE: w.el

Simple live serving system for static files. As of now, this depends on
[[https://crates.io/crates/live-server][live-server]] to work. If you are using ~use-package~, just do the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package w
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/lepisma/w.el.git")
  :demand t
  :ensure-system-package (live-server . "cargo install live-server"))
#+end_src

Once installed, you can call ~w-start-here~ or ~w-start~ to run the live
server. You can also customize the port ~w-start-port~ which is set to a default
of 8080 right now.
