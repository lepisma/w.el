#+TITLE: w.el

Simple live serving system for static files. As of now, this depends on
[[https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server][live-server]] to work which you would need to install before using.

Once installed, you can call ~w-start-here~ or ~w-start~ to run the live
server. You can also customize the port ~w-start-port~ which is set to a default
of 8080 right now.
